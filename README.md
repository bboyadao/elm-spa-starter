This is a simple starter application for Elm Single Page Applications.

It is mostly based on https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example and it only includes (for now) a simple implementation of routing and use of SCSS.

## How to Use

* Install [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
* (Optional) Install [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* Run the app: `elm reactor`, `parcel index.html`, `yarn start` or `npm start`


### Full Application Examples:
For a full application example look at the [Real World Example] (https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-spa-example) or at [Elm Packages] (https://github.com/elm/package.elm-lang.org)
